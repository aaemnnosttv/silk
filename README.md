A modern API for WordPress.

**The current API is still evolving as the project grows closer to v1.0 and may introduce breaking changes.**

Use with confidence, upgrade with care.

## What is Silk?

Silk is a library designed as a thin layer on top of WordPress, abstracting away the mess of functions into a clean and expressive object-oriented API.  Use as much or little as you want, while maintaining compatibility with everything else that's meant to work with WordPress.

[Read the documentation](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/silk-docs) for examples and more.

Or check out the [API documentation](https://api.silk.aaemnnost.tv/master/) if you're into that kind of thing.

## Installation

#### Via Composer (Recommended)
```
composer require silk/silk:^0.11
```
